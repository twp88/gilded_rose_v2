# Gilded Rose Part Two
This is a re-work of the Gilded Rose test that I had already previously committed (see the other repository). I've worked on refactoring and reducing the amount of code. To do so I made the methods class a module, which the gilded rose class could then use. There are still two tests failing, but feel free to take a look!
